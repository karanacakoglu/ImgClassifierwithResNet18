### 🛠️ Technical Workflow
The implementation follows a professional deep learning pipeline:

* **Model Selection:** Chose **ResNet18** as a lightweight yet powerful backbone for visual feature extraction.
* **Pre-trained Weights:** Utilized weights trained on ImageNet to significantly reduce convergence time and improve generalizability.
* **Layer Customization:** Replaced the final fully connected layer to match the number of classes in the target dataset.
* **Training Strategy:** Implemented optimization techniques such as learning rate scheduling and data augmentation to enhance model robustness.
